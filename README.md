# Hackintosh-ASUSTUF-F15-FX506L-OPENCORE

Repository for everyone looking how to make this laptop (Asus TUF Gaming F15 FX506L) run MacOS Monterey 12.5.1.

This repo was created after I was able to boot with the desktop files for Comet Lake platform. Most of the work to get this to work, was done by VGerris and his repository: https://github.com/VGerris/asus-tuf-15-opencore.

** Mac-OS Version: Monterey 12.5.1 **
